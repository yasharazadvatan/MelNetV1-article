# MelNetV1
A real-time single stage object detection model.
This model is trained on KITTI dataset.


# How to Use
1. Download the checkpoint from the link below:

3. Run the codes from MelNet-inference.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
4. This codes load the dataset in YOLO format. You can see an annotation example in './dataset/valid_example/labels' folder.
5. If you have your own custom dataset with different annotation system, then you can train it by running thecodes in MelNet.ipynb in jupyter notebook. You can change the codes for your purposes to load the dataset.
